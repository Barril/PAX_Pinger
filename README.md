PAX_Pinger
==========

Just a stupid little python script to ping twitter and the PAX site to watch for changes.

Uses <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter#downloads">this twitter library.</a>

Done in collaboration over a few days of waiting and mutual boredom with <a href="https://github.com/thejbw">the_jbw</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Barril">Barril</a>.  Went through a lot of iterations, from a simple scraper for the PAX site, to that plus a twitter HTML scraper, to actually using the twitter API.

You'll need your own twitter API key.  And stuff.
